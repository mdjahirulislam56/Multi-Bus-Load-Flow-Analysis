# Multi-Bus-Load-Flow-Analysis
A steady-state Load Flow Analysis of a 9-bus power system using the Newton-Raphson method. Modeled in PowerWorld Simulator and validated with MATLAB , this project calculates bus voltages, phase angles, and power flows to assess system stability and active/reactive power losses.
